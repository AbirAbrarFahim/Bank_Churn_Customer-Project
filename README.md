**Recommendations:**

*Data Quality: Clean and prepare data by addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies early in the process. High-quality data ensures better modeling 
 results.

*Feature Engineering: Carefully engineer features that are meaningful and relevant to customer churn prediction. This increases model accuracy and provides 
 insights into customer behavior.

*Model Selection & Evaluation: Start with simple models like logistic regression for a baseline and then progress to more complex models like Random Forest to 
 capture complex patterns. Regularly evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

*Multicollinearity: Check for multicollinearity and remove or combine correlated features to enhance model stability.

*Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning models like Random Forest can significantly improve their performance. Use techniques like Grid Search to find optimal parameters.
